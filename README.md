# meditor
GUI tool for changing file creation and modification dates, written in Swift

# Why

A ton of my photo files have the wrong dates in the info, as a result of exporting from Photos.

You can't change the date created/modified from Finder's file info view. 

You can use SetFile, from the command line, but that was a little tedious for my use-case.

So I built this.

# The code might suck

This is my first Swift program, and I borrowed some solutions from Stack Overflow (links in code).
